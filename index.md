# 🌌 TEP-UCD - Discover Gravitational Secrets of the Universe

[![Download TEP-UCD](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20TEP--UCD-blue.svg)](https://github.com/omkar441/TEP-UCD/releases)

## 📜 Description

TEP-UCD unifies scales from atoms to galaxies through the concept of gravitational solitons. This application helps you understand critical density in the universe. It derives a value of ρ_c ≈ 20 g/cm³ using GNSS clocks and validates the findings across various cosmic scales, from SPARC galaxies to magnetars.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Discover Cosmic Phenomena:** Explore relationships in astrophysics through user-friendly tools.
- **Accurate Densities:** Understand critical density with precision.
- **Validate Findings:** See data backed by observations across galaxies and compact objects.
- **Easy Navigation:** Simple interface designed for all users, regardless of expertise.
